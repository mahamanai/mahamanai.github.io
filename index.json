    "summary": "During the Great Recession, the United States introduced a temporary program that allowed to extend the duration of unemployment benefits. I ask if these extensions contributed to better health. To answer this question, I differentiate between two health measures: self-reported general health which is highly correlated with the real health status and mental health which is a subjective and retrospective evaluation of oneâ€™s mental health. \n\nI find that both the introduction and expiry of this program had a negative effect on the general health of long term unemployed job seekers, i.e., those looking for work for more than a year. While the negative health response to the programâ€™s expiry is a response to a cut of benefits, the introduction only represents news on benefit extensions and since information on eligibility of the long term unemployed might have not been clear to them yet, their negative health response could be interpreted as an externality. Mental health is not affected by the introduction and expiry of the program. \n\nIn addition, I design a strategy to assess the effects of the extensions triggered by state level unemployment. These state level changes in benefits improve mental health during August 2008 to December 2008, but not thereafter.\n",

    "summary": "I examine how university graduates use public employment services in Tunisia in terms of registration, internship programs participation and subsidies received. \n\nIn a context where students submit rank-ordered lists to indicate their preferences, I look at students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) who pursue their studies in two different tracks with one being more selective in terms of peer quality and prestige. The selective track ranks high and attracts students with high admission scores, whereas the non-selective track ranks lower and has students with lower admissions scores. \n\nUsing a regression discontinuity design based on discontinuities in university admission scores, I find that getting into the selective track increases the likelihood of registration at the public employment agency after five years of university studies by 11 percentage points. \n\nAdditional suggestive evidence shows that attending the selective track decreases the participation in the active labor market policy internship programs by 15 percentage points but does not cost more in average subsidies paid relative to the regular track. This suggests that the labor market is unable to quickly absorb the most able university graduates.\n",

    "summary": "The literature suggests that probability weighting and choice set dependence influence risky choices. However, their relative importance has not been tested jointly. We present a joint test that uses binary choices between lotteries provoking Common Consequence and Common Ratio Allais Paradoxes and manipulates their correlation structure. \n\nWe show non-parametrically that probability weighting and choice set dependence both play a role at describing aggregate choices. To parsimoniously account for heterogeneity, we also estimate a structural model using a finite mixture approach. The model uncovers substantial heterogeneity and classifies subjects into three types: 38% Prospect Theory types whose choices are predominantly driven by probability weighting, 34% Salience Theory types whose choices are predominantly driven by choice set dependence, and 28% Expected Utility Theory types. \n\nThe model predicts type-specific differences in the frequency of preference reversals out-of-sample, i.e., in choices with a different context than the ones used for estimating the model. Moreover, the out-of-sample predictions indicate that the choice context shapes the influence of choice set dependence.\n",
