    "summary": "We exploit large changes in the unemployment insurance (UI) maximum duration in the United States to study the effect of having UI for a longer period on self-reported general health and number of days of bad mental health. Using two complementary approaches, a regression discontinuity design at the time of the change in potential UI duration and a fuzzy differences-in-differences approach introduced by de Chaisemartin and Dâ€™HaultfÅ“uille (2017), we find that while the most advertised and important changes in potential UI duration have a large negative but noisy effect on the number of bad mental health days, it does not have a significant effect on self-reported general health. Since we interpret the general health measure as a health report in real time and the mental health measure as a retrospective global evaluation of oneâ€™s health, we expect larger and more important effects of UI duration on mental health compared to general health (Kahneman et al., 2006).",

    "summary": "We analyze the relative importance of probability weighting and choice set dependence in describing risky choices both non-parametrically and with a structural model. Our experimental design uses binary choices between lotteries that may trigger Allais Paradoxes. We change the choice set by manipulating the correlation structure of the lotteriesâ€™ payoffs while keeping their marginal distributions constant. This allows us to discriminate between probability weighting and choice set dependence. There are three main results. First, probability weighting and choice set dependence both play a role in describing aggregate choices. Second, the structural model uncovers substantial individual heterogeneity which can be parsimoniously characterized by three types: 38% of subjects engage primarily in probability weighting, 34% are influenced predominantly by choice set dependence, and 28% are mostly rational. Third, the classification of subjects into types predicts preference reversals out-of-sample. These results may not only further our understanding of choice under risk but may also prove valuable for describing the behavior of consumers, investors, and judges.",

Using a regression discontinuity design at the admission score cut-offs, I study the effect of going to a higher ranked program in terms of peer quality on the use of government-assisted job search. My initial findings point out that education has not effect on the use of government-assisted job search which allows me to argue that there is no selection on the education level when it comes to using the services of the public employment agency.",
