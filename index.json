    "summary": "During the Great Recession, the United States introduced a temporary program that allows to extend the duration of unemployment insurance. In this paper, we ask if these extensions contributed to better health or perception of oneâ€™s health. To answer this question, we differentiate between two health measures: self-reported general health which is highly correlated with the real health status and mental health which is a subjective and retrospective evaluation of oneâ€™s mental health. On the one hand, estimates from two different models suggest that extending benefits only enhance mental health but this result is mostly mitigated by low precision. On the other hand, cutting all income assistance at once at the expiry of the program affected negatively the health of long term unemployed by 14%. In this analysis, we distinguish between two types of extensions in two different models. The first model consists on a regression discountinuity approach where time is the running variable and the treatment corresponds to the introduction/expiry of the extended benefits policy in all United States. Whilst the second model, a difference-in-differences framework, focuses on the effect of conditional treatment in the form of additional weeks of coverage in certain states that reach a pre-determined high level of unemployment.",

    "summary": "We analyze the relative importance of probability weighting and choice set dependence in describing risky choices both non-parametrically and with a structural model. Our experimental design uses binary choices between lotteries that may trigger Allais Paradoxes. We change the choice set by manipulating the correlation structure of the lotteriesâ€™ payoffs while keeping their marginal distributions constant. This allows us to discriminate between probability weighting and choice set dependence. There are three main results. First, probability weighting and choice set dependence both play a role in describing aggregate choices. Second, the structural model uncovers substantial individual heterogeneity which can be parsimoniously characterized by three types: 38% of subjects engage primarily in probability weighting, 34% are influenced predominantly by choice set dependence, and 28% are mostly rational. Third, the classification of subjects into types predicts preference reversals out-of-sample. These results may not only further our understanding of choice under risk but may also prove valuable for describing the behavior of consumers, investors, and judges.",

    "summary": "In a rigid labor market unable to absorb the expanding university educated labor force under the free public education policy, the Tunisian government relies heavily on expensive active labor market policy tools to aid university graduates as they transition from school to work. In this paper, I examine the disconnect between higher education and employment in Tunisia. Using a regression discontinuity design based on discontinuities in university admission scores, I compare two groups of university students who chose similar fields but different study tracks where one is perceived as better and is preferred to the second by all the students in the study, thus creating a clear sorting in ability. I find that going to a more preferred university program, increases the likelihood of using government job search services by 11 percent but does not cost more in average subsidies paid. As one would expect that the least able group is more likely to struggle to find a first job independently and to use the offered services, this finding suggests that the inadequacy of the labor market leads the most able group to take longer to find a first job.",
